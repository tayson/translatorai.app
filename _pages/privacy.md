* Device type and operating system.

* Usage statistics, such as app usage patterns and features accessed.

* Language preferences and location data (if enabled).

### 1.3. Translations and Input Data

* **With Service Providers:** We may share data with third-party services (e.g., AI or cloud providers) that help us operate and improve the App.

* **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TranslatorAI, our users, or others.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Your Choices

### 5.1. Opting Out

You can choose not to provide personal information. However, this may limit your access to certain features.

### 5.2. Managing Permissions

You can manage or revoke app permissions (e.g., location, microphone) in your device’s settings.

## 7. Third-Party Links

The App may include links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
